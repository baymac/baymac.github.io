I am fascinated by programming languages and their different ways of solving different problems. I am a big time fan of

* Football (Argentina NT, Barcelona FC and Lionel Messi), 
* Movies (LoTR, GoT, Star wars, Avengers, Quentin Tarantino, Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro etc) and 
* 70s Rock bands (Metallica, Queen, Pink Floyd, Eagles, ACDC, GnR).
